        <h2>The Goal:</h2>
        <p>We want to improve public safety by making crime information from PG County more accessible as well as make the process of 
          researching a prospective area simpler</p>
        <h2 class="problem">The Problem:</h2>
        <p>The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of accessible information the general public has on their communities.
          New and prospective residents lack resources about potential places they could move in Prince George’s county. 
          When looking for a new place, people who do not have any knowledge of the area have to do thorough research online that 
          may require combing through pages of public neighborhood forums. We want to eliminate that need and help users get a 
          general understanding of the area prior to diving in deeper. </p>

        <h2 class="solution"> The Solution:</h2>
        <p>With our proposed system, our website will serve as a user centered database. 
          The users will be able to see information related to security and safety concerns within different areas of 
          Prince George’s county. More specifically, users would be able to search an address within our search feature. 
          From there, they would be able to see the corresponding information based on the address they entered.
